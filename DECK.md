## The Problem

Every crypto game is the same: deposit, wait, maybe win.  
No skill. No story. No reason to care.

---

## The Solution: Pink MythOS

An **AI-powered narrative survival game** where players face absurd, impossible dilemmas - and stake crypto on their answers.

Think **D&D meets Black Mirror meets Crypto Culture**.

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **The Shiv** | An impossible scenario generated by AI. No right answer. |
| **The Auditors** | Three alien overseers (Jinx, Veyra, Granz) who judge your response. |
| **The Stake** | SOL or $PNKO. Winners take a share of the pool. |
| **The Drama** | The higher the players -> The fewer winners -> the higher the payout. |

## The Economics (On-Chain, Transparent)

### Pool Split: 70 / 7 / 15 / 8

| Share | Destination |
|------:|:------------|
| **70%** | Winners (paid out on-chain) |
| **7%** | Treasury + Governance Partners |
| **15%** | Renewal Vault (burn schedule) |
| **8%** | Next round buffer |

### Power Law Apex Curve

As more players join, **winners drop dramatically** - ROI skyrockets.

| Players | Winners | Avg ROI |
|--------:|--------:|--------:|
| 100 | 21 | **3x** |
| 1,000 | 30 | **23x** |
| 5,000 | 13 | **269x** |
| 10,000 | 8 | **875x** |
| 100,000 | 3 | **23,333x** |

## The Vision

I'm **Anselme Gouanou** - solo founder.

My goal: revive **narrative-based games** (like D&D) and merge them with crypto. Players have fun answering impossible dilemmas. Winners take life-changing payouts.

### Endgame: Full Automation

The **7% Treasury** (split among 3 partners) funds the path to:

- **AI Shiv Generation** - no manual content creation
- **AI Image Generation** - every Shiv gets custom visuals
- **AI Moderation** - no active admin intervention
- **Self-sustaining system** that runs 24/7 without me

## The Ask

I'm forming the **3 Governance Slots** - strategic partners who split the 7% treasury:

1. Understand Solana culture + degenerate economics
2. Want board-level alignment, not a quick flip
3. Can amplify the launch (KOLs, communities, capital, liquidity)

**What you get:**  
- OTC allocation at ground-floor terms  
- Direct governance influence  
- Treasury-side alignment (you win when the house wins)
